# WPF.Materials
A WPF implementation of the new "Materials" in UWP / Fluent Design. The initial library will contain Acrylic, Paint, Smoke, and Metal, with more materials added later.

This WPF library consists of a primary Custom Control and several styles - each style gives you access to different materials.
